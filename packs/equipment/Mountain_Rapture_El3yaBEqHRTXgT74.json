      "value": "<p>The <em>Mountain Rapture</em> is a maul that is created from the core of an Elder Beast of Molten Metal. Defeated long ago by August I, the core was transformed into the weapon of the Schneeberg Royal Family. It was eventually passed down into their son. It is the symbol of the Schneeberg Monarchy.</p><p>The <em>Mountain Rapture</em> is a <em>+3 major striking greater flaming grievous shifting maul</em> made of what appears to be molten steel, though it behaves as if it were made of solid metal. When a creature first picks up <em>Mountain Rapture</em>, they must succeed at a @Check[will|dc:43] save to establish their dominance over the weapon. On a success, they become <em>Mountain Rapture's </em>only accepted wielder and may use the weapon normally. On a failure, the character takes @Damage[20d6[fire]] damage (@Damage[40d6[fire]] damage on a critical failure) and drops the weapon as it melts away into slag and immediately reforms in an adjacent space. A new attempt to establish dominance can be made by picking the weapon up again and attempting a new Will save. </p><p>Once <em>Mountain Rapture </em>has an accepted wielder, it can't be wielded by anyone else unless the accepted wielder intentionally permits it, declaring so in a loud voice; this permission can be rescinded in a similar manner. Anyone else trying to wield <em>Mountain Rapture </em>after it has accepted a wielder takes fire damage and causes the weapon to melt away as if they failed the Will save to wield it.</p><p>If its wielder was ever killed, the <em>Mountain Rapture </em>melts away and reforms by their remains, awaiting for another person to establish dominance.</p><p>The additional fire damage caused by <em>Mountain Rapture's </em>greater flaming property (but not its persistent fire damage) is splash damage. <em>Mountain Rapture's </em>wielder is immune to this splash damage.</p><p><strong>Activateâ€”Molten Smash</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (concentrate, manipulate)</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> You smash <em>Mountain Rapture </em>against the ground or another solid adjacent surface, causing an explosion of molten metal and force to radiate outward in a @Template[emanation|distance:20]. All creatures in this area take @Damage[10d6[fire]] damage and @Damage[6d6[force]] damage (@Check[reflex|dc:43|basic] save); those who critically fail this save are knocked @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.j91X7x0XSomq8d60]{Prone}. You are immune to the effects of Molten Smash, but your allies are not.</p>"

Whenever you cast a spell which has a casting time of more than 1 action and has a verbal component, you can spread the casting time of the spell, even across turns. You can take any number of actions it would take to cast the spell (a minimum of one) to start casting the spell, and during your next turns, you must spend at least one action to continue the cast (as if you were Sustaining the spell) up to the remainder of the actions required to finish casting the spell.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The casting of the spell fails under the following circumstances:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you do not spend any actions to sustain the casting during your turn,</li>\n<li>If you become unable to concentrate,</li>\n<li>If you use another action that has the Metamagic or Auditory traits.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>"

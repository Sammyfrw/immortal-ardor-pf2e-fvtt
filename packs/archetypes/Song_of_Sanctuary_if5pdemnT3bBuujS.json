Your Song of Reprieve activity improves, bestowing those benefitting from it a +2 status bonus to their next saving throw to overcome poisons, diseases, curses or other magical effects. This benefit is applied each time they recover hit points, so if the saving throw is made multiple times during the ten-minute duration of Song of Reprieve, they would benefit from each saving throw at the two-minute intervals. If multiple saving throws need to be made at the same time, select which saving throw benefits, and the bonus does not apply to the others.</p>"

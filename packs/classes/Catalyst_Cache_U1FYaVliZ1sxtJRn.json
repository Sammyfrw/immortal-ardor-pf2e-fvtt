You’ve developed a technique to create flexible but unstable catalysts that you store in a catalyst cache to preserve them until use.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">  </span>What these catalysts are and how they function are unique to you and your luminary’s medium.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">During your daily preparations, you can create a number of ephemeral catalysts up to 2 + your key attribute score modifier, which is also your maximum number of catalysts. If you’re below your maximum number, you can gather reagents to create more catalysts from the environment around you. For every 10 minutes you spend in exploration mode, you regain 2 catalysts; this doesn’t prevent you from participating in other exploration activities.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Ephemeral catalysts are made up of unstable combinations of ingredients and magic. They are destroyed if not used by the time you make your daily preparations. Only you can activate an ephemeral catalyst that you made.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The catalyst cache behaves similarly to a toolkit, and you can store both ephemeral catalysts and other kinds of catalysts in it. If you ever lose your cache, you can acquire a new one in any settlement or make your own after a day of downtime at negligible cost. Without it, you can only maintain one ephemeral catalyst at a time.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">You gain the @UUID[Compendium.immortal-ardor.classes.DwGZS7yq4aWA3BHb]{Catalyze Spell} action.</p>"

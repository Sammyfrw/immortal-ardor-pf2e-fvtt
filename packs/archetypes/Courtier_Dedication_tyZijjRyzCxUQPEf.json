Whether you have learned it by exposure to Domus’ courts or elsewhere, you sought to give your wits an advantage through spellcraft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You become trained in either Deception, Diplomacy or Intimidate skills; if you are trained in all three, you can pick another skill to be trained in instead. You learn the Glad-Hand feat, even if you are not an Expert in Diplomacy. You also gain a set of fine clothing which includes a felt mask. You gain the Noble’s Mask focus spell. You also have access to the prestidigitation cantrip, and 2 cantrips of your choice from the Occult spell list.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You are trained in occult spell attack rolls and DCs. Your key spellcasting ability for spells you gain from this archetype is Charisma, and they use the occult tradition. If you gain spells from this archetype, you select from the occult spell list.</p>"

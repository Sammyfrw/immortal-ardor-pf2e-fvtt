In addition, during this time you find yourself more nimble. Traveling through corridors slightly smaller than your size allows (such as a 5-foot hallway if you are a Large creature) does not count as difficult terrain, and allies are able to move past you in these corridors.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.immortal-ardor.equipment.i1DDHmsERWMYFMz3]{Effect: Enchiladas de Vapor}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.immortal-ardor.equipment.QPkGDZUaFrSHrYUl]{Effect: Enchiladas de Vapor (Favorite)}</p>"

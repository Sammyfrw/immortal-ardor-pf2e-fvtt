      "value": "<p>Frostbee Honey is a specialty of Schneebergian apiaries. It is a miracle mixture that is used to create all kinds of medicines and enhances their restorative effects. These are typically only found in colder climate mountain regions, where bees have specifically adapted to normally inhospitable climates.</p>\n<p>Very cooling in their flavor, often turning its taste to something more bitter than one might expect, the honey's effects are almost immediately felt after taking just one spoonful. It is a delicate substance, however, and quickly loses its properties if not handled properly or exposed for too long to moisture.</p>\n<p>It can be consumed on its own, where a drinker gains a +3 item bonus to saving throws against diseases and poisons for 10 minutes, and immediately attempts to counteract any ongoing effects.Â </p>\n<p>When used as an ingridient or reagent in making an Etherflow Potion, Elixir of Life, or Healing Potion, it adds these effects to their normal effects, with additional bonuses. In the case of the Etherflow Potion, it adds an additional half amount of levels of its spell recovery value. For an Elixir of Life, its duration is increased to 8 hours instead of 10 minutes. For a Healing Potion, it adds an additional amount of health recovered equal to the potion's healing modifier (minimum 10 hit points).</p>"

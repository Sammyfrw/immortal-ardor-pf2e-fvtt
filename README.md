# immortal-ardor-pf2e-fvtt
This repository contains all the module data for Immortal Ardor for use with the Pathfinder 2nd Edition system on Foundry VTT.

## Overview
This module adds all the data one might need to run a game in the Immortal Ardor setting using the Pathfinder 2nd Edition system. It introduces new classes, new systems, new equipment types, new weapons and armor types, new ancestries, and more. This will include everything from its implementation, linkages, rule elements and macros to ensure a smooth playing experience when running with these elements.

I am working on this module alongside running 2 games, with 1 nearing its completion. Progress will come as these campaigns develop and will likely accellerate after Campaign 1 completes.

## Module Details
This module includes or will include:
* The Manafont System, a new way to interact with focus points and magic for denizens of the primal planes.
* The Facet System, a new way to interact with the constellation for denizens of the astral planes to give rise to miraculous Constellation powers.
* The Ascension System, an alternative optional ruleset to Mythic Rules that emphasizes more on breaking boundaries.
* 4 new classes, each with their own specialty based on a tradition of magic and with very unique playstyles.
* 12 new ancestries and their respective ancestral lineages, some of which are Ardorean analogues to existing PF2e ancestries.
* 3 new versatile heritages, each tackling in-universe niches and concepts of Therianthropes.
* New backgrounds that match characters in the universe of Immortal Ardor.
* An assortment of equipment types, which include Services, Facets, Consumables.
* Both new types of weapons and armor, with new traits, and artifact weapons and armor both.
* Manafont Archetypes - archetypes that tie strongly to the manafont system to truly elevate a class.
* Unseen Deities & Deific Spirits - a large collection of powerful deities that form pantheons and have shaped Ardor's history.
* The Constellation - a group of 13 astral entities that function as deities that ties into in-universe powers of fate, imagination, and destiny.
* Brand new spells and feats - between Constellation feats and spells, new Ardorean spells for spellcasters to take, and more.
* Full implementation of automation, macros and more to ensure a smooth experience when running these systems!

## Roadmap
The current roadmap for this module is as follows:
* Initial Data Entry - Near Complete, though new additions will come as my games progress and certain elements are written out, reformatted, or reworked
* Spells - all spells, including ones from facets or other features are added and automated. New additions will come as my games progress, but they will be fully implemented as they are entered.
* Classes - Dervish design, feats and features are complete and all its data has been entered into the module, and macros for its main mechanic was written out. Rules Elements and effects needs to be implemented. Other classes are in various stages of design phases: Soulreaver needs its mechanics finalized to get to writing its feats. Luminary's design and features is complete, but feats need to be written out before it gets added into the module. Diviner needs to have its design and features written out, before feats and then implementation into the module. Implementation of the other 3 classes will come after Ancestries and Heritages, unless they are meant to be used in a game before I get to them.
* Equipment - Most base equipment is implemented. New weapons and armor types and automation for their traits needs to be implemented, pending design rework.
* Ancestries - Pending rework in design and creation of the Ancestral Lineages. 7/12 have their initial lore and set of feats complete, pending rework. 5/12 need to be written out and designed. Will be worked on after Dervish is completed and initial campaign is complete.
* Versatile Heritages - Similar to Ancestries in its plan, scope and priority.
* Background - Needs to be designed, written out, and added.

## Special Thanks
I'd like to put in a huge thank you to a number of people who managed to get me to this point.

* My partner, who has thoroughly encouraged me to make Immortal Ardor into a bigger, real thing. I have aspirations to develop this in ways to get a proper book of the setting out one day, along with the ways on how people can play them. This module is one step of that, and frankly, much easier than all the book writing work. :)
* My players, who have shown me so much love and appreciation by being part of the world I had only dreamed of as a kid. It is so exciting to see it flesh out as the campaigns are run, to see it take shape and into its own as we tell stories in it.
* The Foundry VTT and Pathfinder 2e Discord communities, who have been very patient and helpful, and developed this software and system that allowed me to run this game nigh seamlessly.
* TikaelSol and Websterguy in particular, who has answered and fielded so many of my questions as I try and figure this out. The various scripts to extract packs and build them are immensely helpful in the transparency it affords me as I implement this module.

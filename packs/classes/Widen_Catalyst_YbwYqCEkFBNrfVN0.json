Your catalyzed spell’s area expands; you add 5 feet to the radius of a burst that normally has a radius of at least 10 feet (a burst with a smaller radius is not affected). Add 5 feet to the length of a cone or line that is normally 15 feet long or smaller and add 10 feet to the length of a larger cone or line.</p><p>You can instead choose to use this feat without using an ephemeral catalyst. If you do, this action loses the Catalyze trait but requires you to spend an action, and your next action must be to Cast a Spell that meets the trigger’s requirements, as normal for Spellshapes.</p><p><strong>Enhanced Catalyst</strong> You spend your catalyst and take the time to empower your technique. You add 1 to this action’s catalyze trait and you increase the amount of feet added to ranges by this feat by an additional 5.</p>"

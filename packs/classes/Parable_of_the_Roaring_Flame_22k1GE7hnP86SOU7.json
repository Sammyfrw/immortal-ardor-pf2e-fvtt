See how it warms…See how it burns! A passion, a fashion, a beginning to the end. It draws the breath away with each lick; it elicits a cry with a prick. A sign of how one lives, and dies, and lies in our minds.</em></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN\">The Roaring Flame represents the multifaceted intricacies of life. It flickers and lashes with the wind and has the power to create and destroy. Heat is crucial to how living creatures survive, and yet it can cause immense pain. To embody this fire is to understand how each movement and flow can cause the world to bend to their will. Fire is essential, and thus fire is power.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN\">Dervishes of the Roaring Flame are explosive with their actions and movements.

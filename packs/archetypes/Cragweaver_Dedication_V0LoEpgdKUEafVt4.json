You become trained in one armor type of your choice (Light, Medium, Heavy); when your proficiency in armor increases, your proficiency in this type of armor increases as well. You also become trained in Performance and learn the Fascinating Performance feat. If you are already trained in Performance, you become trained in a skill of your choice. When someone is fascinated by you, they take a -1 penalty to their saving throws against your spells.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Your source of power is determined by which of the two spellcasting traditions you have access to at the time you take this dedication, choosing either Primal or Divine if you have both. You use your chosen spellcasting tradition’s proficiency for spell attack rolls and DCs, and if you gain a spell from this archetype, they are of this tradition. </p>"

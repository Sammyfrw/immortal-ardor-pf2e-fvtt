You can craft catalysts and know the formulas for all common catalysts of your level or lower. You remember catalyst formulas and don’t need a formula book for them.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">Additionally, your catalyst cache contains reagents that you can turn into temporary catalysts. Each day during your daily preparations, you can make two catalysts with an item level no higher than half your level. You must know each catalyst’s formula. A catalyst created this way is temporary, and loses its magic the next time you make your daily preparations if you haven’t used it. Any saving throw DC required by a temporary catalyst you create uses the highest of your spell DC or the talisman’s DC.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN\">At 6th level, you can make four catalysts. At 10th level, you can make six catalysts.</span></p>"

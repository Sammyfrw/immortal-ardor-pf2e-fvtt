The DCs to Cook or Discover the Special Meal are presented here.<br /><strong>Requirements</strong> If a meal has any other special requirements for its preparation (such as the cook's ability to cast <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><a style=\"text-decoration:underline\" href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=48\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">divine</span></a></span> spells or a proficiency rank in a specific skill), that requirement is listed here.

A special meal that has a failure grants no additional benefits or penalties, but still prevents starvation.<br />Many special meal effects persist for a full 24 hours, but a character can only benefit from one special meal effect at a time. If the PCs are camping daily, you can rule that existing special meal effects end once the party takes step 3 of camping (Eating), even if technically 24 hours hasn't passed since the last time they gained bonuses from special meals, so that new effects from new meals can take their place going forward.</p>"

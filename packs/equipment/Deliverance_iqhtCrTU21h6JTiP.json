Two edges - sharp, clean edge on one side, and serrated on the other. The blades have a deep red metal groove within the starlight metal that seem to alight when life force drains from a foe, seeping into a hungry, deep reddish-purple amethyst centered in the apex of the handle that glows even more powerfully when filled with antivitae. In the darkness, it radiates with with starry light - a sight befitting a Fang of Arghal. With this, the Liferender's control over life and death is as if it hung on a razor's edge.</em> </span><br class=\"Apple-interchange-newline\" /></p><hr /><p>Deliverance is a +3 major striking keen bloodthirsty wounding scythe made out of high-grade blacksteel and , an alloy that consists of steel and some form of infused meteorite, giving the black blade a starry feature within it.</p><p>Notably, despite being a polearm, the scythe functions as if it was part of the Sword group for the purposes of its critical specialization.</p><hr /><p>While invested, Deliverance confers the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Activity: Integrated Staff </strong>During your daily preparation, you can attune to a staff and charge it like you would normally; You can channel these charges into the weapon, allowing you to use the scythe as if it was a staff until your next daily preparation. The staff loses all of its charges as it is transferred into the scythe, and the scythe when used as a staff has the benefits of the staff when it casts spells.</p></li><li><p><strong>Antivitae Reservoir </strong>When you use Antivitae, you can store up to 10 points of life energy into the scythe. When you cast Heal, Harm or use Antivitae again, you can add the amount of stored life energy to the amount of positive or negative damage or healing dealt. If it gains a +2 potency rune, you can store up to 20 points of life energy; if it gains a +3 potency rune, you can store up to 30 points of life energy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bloody Feasting </strong><span style=\"font-family:'gg sans', 'Noto Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif\">When you inflict persistent bleed damage on to an enemy, it is harder to get rid of. It requires a DC20 flat check to remove, or DC15 if the bleeding creature or an ally assists with the recovery. Additionally, when a creature sustains damage from your persistent bleeding damage, you gain an equal amount of points to your antivitae reservoir. @UUID[Item.iRgyrXem85Ia5CBO]{Effect: Bloody Feasting}</span></p></li></ul>",

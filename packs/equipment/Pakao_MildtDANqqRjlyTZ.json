Grown and shaped around as a loose-fit robe-like dress that slings over her right shoulder, wrapped in natural serenity. However, when faced with a struggle, the wearer's ether surges within the armor itself, causing sparks to dance across its form. The flames threaten to burn away the abundance once there and consume it, allowing flames to spring and curl out from her left side and expose the hellfire that burns within. In every act of defiance and struggle, even the earth's fury burns bright and resolute against that which would try and consume her.</em></span></p><hr /><p><span style=\"font-family:'gg sans', 'Noto Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif\">By default, as part of the enchantment of the armor, it takes the form of either the Overgrowth dress, or Hellfire dress - both crafted to fit Aerith. You can swap between the dresses by twirling in place as an action, letting the enchantment burn away, or regrow into the other form, or when you enter Earthen Rage.</span></p><p>This armor is a +3 greater resilient greater cold resistant rockbraced greater fortification hellgleam Chain Shirt.

Instead of these actions, you can instead Stride a second time. All these actions are done without provoking reactions (but it does not include avoiding reactions from casting Dazzling Spin itself). If you Cast a Spell, it must be a 1 or 2 action spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, but you can only Stride up to half your speed. If you choose to Stride a second time, you can move your full speed.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You can only Stride up to half your speed without provoking reactions.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You fumble your spin, and the spell does nothing.</p>"

Your clone appears identical to you in every way and sounds, smells, and feels appropriately like yourself. The image can’t speak, but you can speak through it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In combat, it uses your spell attack roll for attacks, has an AC that matches your occult spell DC and bonus to saves and skills that are equal to your spell DC - 10. If it is hit by any attack, takes damage or fails a save, the clone immediately dissipates. It can use 2 actions per turn, which it uses when you Sustain the Spell. It is also substantial enough that it can flank other creatures.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The illusion can cause damage by making the target believe the illusion's attacks are real, but it cannot otherwise directly affect the physical world. If the illusion hits with a Strike, the target takes mental damage equal to 1d6 plus your spellcasting ability modifier, which is nonlethal. This is a mental effect. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does not deactivate regeneration or trigger other effects that require a certain damage type. The GM should track illusory damage dealt by the illusion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion. When a creature disbelieves the illusion, it recovers from half the damage it had taken from it (if any) and doesn't take any further damage from it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Heightened(4th)</strong>: The clone’s damage increases to 2d6 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened(5th)</strong>: You can choose to make the clone’s damage lethal.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened(6th)</strong>: The clone’s damage increases to 3d6 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened(7th)</strong>: When the clone takes damage, you can recast this spell as a reaction.</p>\n<p><strong> Heightened(8th)</strong>: The clone’s damage increases to 4d6 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.</p>"

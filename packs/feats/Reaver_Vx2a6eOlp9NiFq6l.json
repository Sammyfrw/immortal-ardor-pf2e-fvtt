Unlike other manafonts, reavers can only sustain their ether by utilizing ether within living or spiritual beings – sometimes even the recently deceased -- or taking it for themselves. It is said that to accomplish this feat, their souls possess the power to reach out to ether through the souls or the blood of others. For this reason, they are often faced with prejudices of being corpse-eaters, vampires or ghouls, to the point where the stigma has disproportionately led reavers to ether deficiencies. However, on average reavers need to only consume fresh meat or vegetables (sometimes raw) to meet their needs, if they are not active. Adventuring reavers, however, need to be more creative.</span></p><h2><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Reaver Focus Point Feature</span></span></h2><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin\">Reavers start with varying focus points after their daily preparations depending on the activities they take as part of it. These activities are similar to their Refocus activities, which include the consumption of food, communion to borrow ether from spirits, or absorption of ether from recently fallen corpses or remnants.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin\">In general, consider the focus points they gain as equivalent to if they performed a Refocus activity, but with additional points up to their maximum depending on the quality of the rest and their activities. Fresher and fuller meals, more intentional drawing in of ether, or more meaningful communions will grant more points than normal.</span></p><h2><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Reaver Refocus</span></span></h2><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin\">When Reavers refocus, they incorporate one of the below deeds as part of their Refocus. Depending on circumstance, these may require skill checks such as Survival (to subsist and find fresh food), or Arcana or Occultism (drawing in ether from corpses or remnants), or Nature or Religion (to commune with spirits) which would take up the ten-minute period. If they have ready access to any source for their focus points, they are free to perform other activities during the ten-minute period. At the end of the activity, they gain 1 focus point.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin\">Refocus activities include:</span></p><ul><li><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin\">Eating fresh meat, fruit or vegetables, which have not been heavily cooked/processed. Dried foods and general rations usually do not provide the sustenance required for a focus point.</span></p></li><li><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin\">Absorbing ether from a recent corpse, including undead or remnant remains.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin\">Communing and borrowing power from any present spirits; you must be able to communicate with them in some fashion to entreat power from them in this way.</span></p></li></ul><p>If you select a feat that improves your Refocus, you can gain an additional focus point in the ten-minute period by doubling up on an activity or performing multiple of the above activities.</p><h2><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin\"><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\">@UUID[Compendium.immortal-ardor.feats.Item.ndVxIgrgVrMCQmga]{Drain Ether} (5</strong></span><sup><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin\"><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\">th</strong></span></sup><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin\"><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\">)</strong></span></h2><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin\">You can channel a connection another creature’s ether to pull it away from them to take it as your own.

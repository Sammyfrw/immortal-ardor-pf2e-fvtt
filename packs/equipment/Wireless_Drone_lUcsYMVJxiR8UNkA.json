When you Command the drone, you can see through the drone, either through a screen within the vehicle, through a connected synapse, or similar tech eye-wear or implants.</p><p>If it leaves its established radius, the drone attempts to return back to the radius, otherwise it starts to rapidly lose signal and floats to the ground at the end of its last turn.</p>"

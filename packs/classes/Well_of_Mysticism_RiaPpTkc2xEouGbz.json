You take 10 minutes to recite, read or focus on your parableâ€™s lessons, and channel that into a power of healing. You may Refocus while taking this activity.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN\">At the end of the ten minutes, roll a @Check[religion|dc:15] Religion check against a DC 15. On a success, roll an [[/r 8d4]] to determine a pool of healing. On a critical success, you add 16 to this pool. You can then distribute this amount as healing to any number of creatures who are near enough to hear you.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN\">If you are an Expert in Religion, you can roll @Check[religion|dc:20] against a DC 20 to increase the roll by an [[/r 12d4]]{additional 4d4 (total 12d4)} and add another 8 to the pool on a critical success. If you are a Master, you can roll @Check[religion|dc:30] against a DC 30 to increase the roll by [[/r 16d4]]{another increment (total 16d4) } of the same amount, and if you are Legendary, you can roll against @Check[religion|dc:40] a DC 40 to increase it [[/r 20d4]]{once more (total 20d4)}.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN\">Instead of rolling for the pool of healing, you can instead choose to spend an additional 50 minutes for a total of an hour. If you do, you gain a pool as if you critically succeeded and rolled the maximum amount on the dice.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN\">Once a creature has benefited from the healing, they are temporarily immune to the healing for 1 hour.</span></p>"

On a hit, the target’s essence is wracked and temporarily frayed, leaving them Sickened 1. This effect lasts for 1 round, until they recover by retching, or until the next instance of damage they take from an attack or a damaging spell. When the effect wears off, the realignment of their essence is violent and erupts with a blast of spiritual energy. The strength of this eruption is dependent on the amount of Zeal spent:</span></p><ul><li><p><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"color:black\">1-2 Zeal: The target takes an additional 1d6 spirit damage.</span></p></li><li><p><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"color:black\">3-4 Zeal: The target takes an additional 2d6 spirit damage.</span></p></li><li><p><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"color:black\">5 Zeal: As 3-4 Zeal, but the target becomes Sickened 1 for 1 round.</span></p></li></ul><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN\">If the initial Sickened effect wears off due to damage from an attack or a damaging spell, combine the additional spirit damage if it is of the same damage type for the purposes of resistances and weaknesses.</span></p>"

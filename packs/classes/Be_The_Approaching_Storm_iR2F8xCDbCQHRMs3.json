During your Stride, creatures you move past that end up in your aura need to make a @Check[fortitude|against:dervish|basic] against your Dervish Class DC or take @Damage[max(8,(8+2*floor((@actor.level-14)/2)))d8[bludgeoning]] damage.</p><p>You can choose creatures to automatically critically succeed this saving throw.

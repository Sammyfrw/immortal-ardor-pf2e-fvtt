The origin of chemicalyzed zombies is often debated, but every war involving necromancy frequently has them, which leads to the idea that they were built for war. Its prevalence in many military weapons does not discredit this conclusion.</p><p>Almost all too curiously, sulfur is also very commonly associated with and mined from the hellfire and brimstones of hellish realms.</p>"

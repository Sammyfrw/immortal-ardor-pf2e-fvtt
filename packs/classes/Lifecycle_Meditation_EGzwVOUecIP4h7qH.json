      "value": "<p>You recount the parables of the Winding Cycle, and enter a trance. While you are in this trance, the elements and nature seem to shift around you. If you were on water, it ripples. If you stand on grass, plants seem to grow then wither when you leave. Rock crumbles and reforms. With each recitation, you and your companion’s features shift further into the qualities of the elements you invoke, such as the formation of rime or growth of steel.</p><p>When you cast this spell, you gain 2 Zeal and envelop yourself and your companions in elemental energy. Once per round when you Cast this spell or sustain this spell, this energy flares to the element of the recitation. You can only recite Be As One, one recitation of your choice, chosen when you cast this spell, and any recitation that has a trait that matches any of your companions’ elemental traits.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Be As One</strong>: You and your companions are beholden to the same walk of life. You Command an Animal companion.</p></li><li><p><strong>Traverse the World (Air, Traversal)</strong>: A breeze blows and lightens steps. You or one of your companions Stride or Tumble Through, as the wind aids momentum.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tide That Writhes (Water)</strong>: Water has the power to allow or deny life flourishing. A 5-foot emanation of water pools beneath you and one of your companions for 1 round, and its motions cause difficult terrain for your enemies.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Heaviest Footfalls (Earth)</strong>: The earth withstands the steps of every creature born upon it. You or one of your companions Step or Trip a creature within reach, as the earth quakes and throttles with each motion.</p></li><li><p><strong>Evoke Destruction (Fire, Emotion)</strong>: Flames roar, heralding great and terrifying change. You or one of your companions can attempt to Demoralize a creature within 30 feet.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fallen Leaves (Wood)</strong>: As the leaves fall, the underbrush grows. You or one of your companions can attempt to Sneak or Feint. While remaining within 20 feet of each other, magical leaves swirl and grant concealment to the one attempting the check until the end of your turn.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sturdier than Steel (Metal):</strong> The world has weathered pain far greater than any of its parts. Part of your or one of your companion’s body is covered in a metallic carapace for 1 round, granting a +2 circumstance bonus to AC.</p></li></ul><hr /><p><strong>Heightened (4th)</strong>: If your recitation involves a skill check that targets a single enemy and it succeeds, that creature is off-guard for 1 round.</p><p><strong>Heightened (8th):</strong> If you recite Be As One, the companion you command becomes Quickened for 1 round; they can use this action to Stride, Strike, or use their Support Ability.</p>"

      "value": "<p>You mentally recite the parables of the silent moon, and enter a trance. Your eyes almost gloss over and you appear distant, but you can sense everything around you in great detail. There is almost a cold chill about you and your movements become deliberate and directed. As you take in the world around you, you feel all opportunities become open to you to make great changes like the moon.</p><p>When you cast this spell, you gain 2 Zeal. Once per round when you cast this spell or when you sustain this spell, your gaze pierces a target creature you are observing within 30 feet. Choose one of the following recitations:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Moonglare</strong>:  Make a Perception check against the target’s Deception or Stealth DC, whichever is higher. This counts as a Sense Motive check for any benefits you may have to taking Sense Motive actions. On a success, you glean a sense of the target’s movements and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your AC and saving throw against their next attack or spell for 1 round (+2 on critical success).</p></li><li><p><strong>Darkmoon</strong>: Make a Stealth check against the target’s Perception DC. This counts as a Hide check for any benefits you may have to Hide actions. On a success, a flicker of moon’s dark grips the target’s senses and you become Concealed to that creature, and on a critical success you become Hidden instead. This effect lasts for 1 round, until you take a hostile action against that creature, or until they take a hostile action against you.</p></li></ul><hr /><div><p><strong>Heightened (7th):</strong> The bonus for Moonglare increases to +2 on a success, or +3 on a critical success.</p><p><strong>Heightened (9th):</strong> Darkmoon’s benefits do not end when you take a hostile action or when the creature takes a hostile action against you.</p></div>"

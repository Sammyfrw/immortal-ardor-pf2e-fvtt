If you are sustaining an illusion, whenever you Sustain the Spell your illusion can perform a ranged Strike using your spell attack modifier against a creature that has not yet disbelieved it within 30 feet of you or your illusion. On a hit, the creature takes psychic damage equal to half your level plus the spell’s level. In the event your illusion comprises of multiple entities, you treat each spell you are sustaining as a singular illusion for the purpose of this attack.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the illusion’s attack is done in such a way that could compromise the illusion, the target can immediately use a Seek action to disbelieve it. For example, if your illusion is an object that the target is observing, it would make a Seek action. If the target is facing away (and thus it is unobserved), the target might not know where the source of the psychic damage is coming from.</p>"

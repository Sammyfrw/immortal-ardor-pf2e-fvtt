      "value": "<p>Your communion with nature and journey of uncovering life’s deepest truths have cultivated a following. You gain the service of a young animal or elemental companion that travels with you and obeys your commands. Contrary to the usual rules for animal companions, this feat can grant you a second companion. If you ever have more than one companion, you gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.8kGpUUUSX1sB2OqQ]{Call Companion} action.</p><p>If you have or gain companions and they do not have an elemental trait already, choose one from the following list: Fire, Water, Air, Earth, Metal, Wood, whichever is appropriate to you or your companion. This has no bearing on the companion’s statistics, but is used in several Sojourner features. This represents an element your companion embodies as they journey with you, typically one they interface with often in life – such as air for birds, or water for otters.</p><hr /><p><strong>SOJOURNER COMPANIONS</strong></p><p>As a sojourner, you determine the statistics and abilities of your animal or elemental companions. it's possible for you to have more than one animal companion at one time—up to four companions—but only one of those companions, your “active companion,” follows you during exploration and in encounters; the rest are nearby, usually foraging or hunting for food or dormant in the spiritual plane until you call for them.</p><p>As soon as you gain a second animal companion, you also gain @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.8kGpUUUSX1sB2OqQ]{Call Companion} to switch your active companion. These rules apply to all your companions, regardless of whether you got the animal companion from the sojourner archetype or from another source.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.immortal-ardor.journals.JournalEntry.kyuzYhmQ3AJTXytJ.JournalEntryPage.FFSn744uXfukAH7u]{Sojourner (Class Archetype)}</p>"

As a reaction to an attack that would hit you, you can attempt to misdirect the attack towards a projection of yourself.</p>\n<p>If the attack roll is a success, the image absorbs the damage, as well as any additional effects it may have. If an attack roll is a critical success and would hit the image, it is destroyed and the attack roll becomes a success against you. When the image is destroyed, your Noble’s Mask effect dissipates.</p>"

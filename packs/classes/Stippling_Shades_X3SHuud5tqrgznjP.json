Prior to resolving the outcome of a spell against affected creatures, determine if the targets disbelieve the veiled spell based on their perception. If the spell requires a spell attack, compare the outcome of the roll to a creature’s Perception DC. If it requires a saving throw, targeted creatures need to make a Seek check before rolling their saving throw.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN\">If a creature fails to disbelieve the illusion, they take a -2 status penalty to their AC or saving throw against the spell. If they critically succeed in disbelieving the illusion, they gain a +1 status bonus instead.</span></p><p>@UUID[Compendium.immortal-ardor.classes.7V6zfl6anbjhvHNX]{Spell Effect: Stippling Shades}</p><hr /><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN\"><strong>Heightened (4th) </strong>The duration of this spell increases to 2 rounds.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN\"><strong>Heightened (8th) </strong>Even if you fail to overcome a target’s Perception DC or if they only succeed (but not critically succeed) in their Seek attempt, the target still takes a -1 status penalty to their AC or saving throws against the spell.</span></p>"

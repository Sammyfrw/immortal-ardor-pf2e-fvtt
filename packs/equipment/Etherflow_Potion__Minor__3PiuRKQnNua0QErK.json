Unlike the condensed ether potions made for Invokers which heals the strain on their etherlobes, Etherweave tinctures provide a rejuvenating effect to the body itself, replenishing one's existing reserves.Â </p>\n<p>If you are a spellcaster that utilizes spell slots, while you are in the middle of a Refocus activity you can drink this potion to recover your spell slots. If you are a prepared spellcaster, you regain the spells allocated to the spell slots you recover.</p>\n<p>The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than your level, up to a maximum of 4. None of the slots can be of 2nd level or higher. If you are a spellcaster with a wave spell level progression, you can have a combined level of up to 8, and you can use it on any of your available slots.</p>"

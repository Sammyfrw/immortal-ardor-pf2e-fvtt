As part of this, you have learned to further entreat Guidespectre’s power as a means of channeling more powerful spells easily.</p>\n<p>You gain basic spellcasting benefits, and each time you gain a new spell slot of a new rank from the Mourneblade archetype, add two common spells from your chosen spellcasting tradition of that level to your repertoire.</p>\n<p>In addition, you are granted a basic guidespectre spell by your guidespectre based on your chosen tradition, listed on the guidespectre item entry. This spell is always considered a signature spell for you, but you can only cast this spell if you have a guidespectre summoned. You can use focus points to cast a spell in your repertoire or a spell provided by your Guidespectre, even if the spell slots have already been used, following the cost described for Ether spell costs. </p>"
